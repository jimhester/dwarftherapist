 ** Installing on Windows
 - Open your DF folder, locate SDL.dll and rename it to SDLreal.dll (making
   a backup of it is a good idea)
 - Copy the right DFHack SDL.dll into your DF folder.
 - Restart DF if it is running

 ** Unistalling on Windows
 - Open your DF folder, locate SDL.dll and delete it
 - Rename SDLreal.dll to SDL.dll
 - Restart DF if it is running


 ** Installing on Linux
 - Open your DF folder and the libs folder within it
 - copy DFHack libdfconnect.so to the libs folder
 - copy the df startup script, name it dfhacked
 - open the new dfhacked startup script and add this line:
     export LD_PRELOAD="./libs/libdfconnect.so" # Hack DF!
   just before the line that launches DF

   Here's an example how the file can look after the change:
#!/bin/sh
DF_DIR=$(dirname "$0")
cd "${DF_DIR}"
export SDL_DISABLE_LOCK_KEYS=1 # Work around for bug in Debian/Ubuntu SDL patch.
#export SDL_VIDEO_CENTERED=1 # Centre the screen.  Messes up resizing.
ldd dwarfort.exe | grep SDL_image | grep -qv "not found$"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
 mkdir unused_libs
 mv libs/libSDL* unused_libs/
fi
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"./libs" # Update library search path.
export LD_PRELOAD="./libs/libdfconnect.so" # Hack DF!
./dwarfort.exe $* # Go, go, go! :)

 - Use this new startup script to start DF

 ** Uninstalling on Linux
 - Open your DF and DF/libs folders
 - Delete libdfconnect.so and the dfhacked startup script
 - Go back to using the df startup script
